 #Summary
 #Agent stores Q-values for different(state, action) pairs in a table.
 #Uses exploration (random) vs. exploitation (best known action) to choose actions.
 #Updates Q-values using the Bellman equation after receiving rewards.
 #Gradually shifts from exploring to exploiting by decaying exploration_rate
